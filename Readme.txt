Wilson Resume/CV

Original description:
This Resume/CV template features a spacious layout with a conservative style designed to clearly and simply put forward your work experience and information. The layout is most suited to longer CVs as job descriptions can be quite extensive and can be organized with bullet points or paragraphs of text. The inclusion of a personal profile allows you to succinctly state your career goals and achievements while the skills section lets you list large amounts of technical expertise. Your contact information and your referees' contact information is displayed in customizable blocks allowing you to expand them as needed. This template is most suited to mid-late career professionals with significant amounts of experience.
